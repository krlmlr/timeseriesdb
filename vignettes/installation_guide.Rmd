## Starting Point

This guides assumes you are familiar with your operating system and the 
R environment. In another words we assume you have basic R, basic PostgreSQL as well 
as basic unix shell know-how in case you work on Linux / OSX. 

Also, {timeseriesdb}'s works well inside a docker container which is probably
the most convenient setup for testing purposes if you're familiar with docker. 
However, docker know-how is not a prerequisite for running and installing 
{timeseriesdb} by any means. 


## PostgreSQL 

{timseriesdb} uses the PostgreSQL RDMBS as a database backend. 
You can either use {timeseriesdb} with a remote database running on, e.g., 
[Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres#:~:text=Cloud%20SQL%20for%20PostgreSQL%20is,databases%20on%20Google%20Cloud%20Platform.), [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [Heruko](https://www.heroku.com/postgres) and many more, or you can simply install PostgreSQL 
locally. In both cases the [PostgreSQL docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres)
are a hassle-free solution, in particular if you want to try out timeseriesdb.
Alternatively, just install [PostgreSQL on your local machine](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). 
To verify that your installation worked make sure the database is running and create 
a basic connection. 


### Dedicated Schema and Extensions

Create a SCHEMA that is dedicated to your {timeseriesdb} instance. 
The PostgreSQL hierarchy looks like this database cluster > database > schema > relation (table). 

Creating a schema is simply a matter of 

```sql

CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS timeseries;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gist;

```

as long as you have the rights to do so. Also, don't forget to install 
to install the uid and btree extension which are needed for the unique identifiers
and the enforcement of constraints {timeseriesdb} makes use of.
