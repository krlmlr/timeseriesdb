## Starting Point

This guide assumes you have installed the {timeseriesdb} R package  and a local PostgreSQL client library successfully. We also assume that you have a PostgreSQL database running somewhere that you can connect to. 

For the remainder of this guide we assume PostgreSQL runs a local 
docker desktop based container accessible on port 1111.
