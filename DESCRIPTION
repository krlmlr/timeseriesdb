Title: Store and Organize Time Series in a Database
Description: An R package to store and organize time series in a simple but
    powerful relational database using PostgreSQL. The timeseriesdb package
    suggests a simple yet powerful database structure to store a large
    amount of time series in a relational PostgreSQL database. The package
    provides an interface to the R user to create, update and delete time
    series. Also, useRs can search the database using R. I plan to extend
    comprehensive support for storing and querying multi-lingual meta
    information in the future.
