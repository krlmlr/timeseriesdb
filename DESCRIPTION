Type: Package
Version: 0.2.9.1
Title: Manage Time Series for Official Statistics with R and PostgreSQL
Description: Store and organize a large amount of low frequency time series
    data. The package was designed to manage a large catalog of official statistics
    which are typically published on monthly, quarterly or yearly basis. Thus
    timeseriesdb is optimized to handle a large number of lower frequency time
    series as opposed to a smaller amount of high frequency time series such as real
    time data from measuring devices. Hence timeseriesdb provides the opportunity to
    store extensive multi-lingual meta information. The package also provides a web
    GUI to explore the underlying PostgreSQL database interactively.
